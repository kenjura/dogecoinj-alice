/**
 * A BlockChain holds a series of {@link Block} objects, links them together, and knows how to verify that the
 * chain follows the rules of the {@link NetworkParameters} for this chain.<p>
 *
 * A BlockChain requires a {@link Wallet} to receive transactions that it finds during the initial download. However,
 * if you don't care about this, you can just pass in an empty wallet and nothing bad will happen.<p>
 *
 * A newly constructed BlockChain is empty. To fill it up, use a {@link Peer} object to download the chain from the
 * network.<p>
 *
 * <b>Notes</b><p>
 *
 * The 'chain' can actually be a tree although in normal operation it can be thought of as a simple list. In such a
 * situation there are multiple stories of the economy competing to become the one true consensus. This can happen
 * naturally when two miners solve a block within a few seconds of each other, or it can happen when the chain is
 * under attack.<p>
 *
 * A reference to the head block of every chain is stored. If you can reach the genesis block by repeatedly walking
 * through the prevBlock pointers, then we say this is a full chain. If you cannot reach the genesis block we say it is
 * an orphan chain.<p>
 *
 * Orphan chains can occur when blocks are solved and received during the initial block chain download,
 * or if we connect to a peer that doesn't send us blocks in order.
